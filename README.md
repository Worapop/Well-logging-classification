# Well-logging-classification
Well logging classification using machine learning models

This project uses the Data from FORGE project (geothermal well). You can access the data by https://gdr.openei.org/submissions/791. 
There are 7 classes in this study:
Class 0: Basalt
Class 1: Claystone
Class 2: Conglomerate
Class 3: Sandstone
Class 4: Siltstone
Class 5: Tuff
Class 6: Vitrophyre

Moreover, there are 4 features such as desity log, porosity log, gamma ray log, and neutron log.
